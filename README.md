### Hi there 👋
This github is mainly used to hold my works for **‘100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023’**

I worked on it daily for the first 30 days. After I have been more familiar with python, I switch to focus more on python with data analysis. So my progress of this course is now on pause.

✨current progress: 37/100✨
